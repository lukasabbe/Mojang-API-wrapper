# An Mojang API wrapper

This is an simple wrapper for Mojangs API. 
Mojangs API routes is documented here [Mojang API](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_API). With this wrapper you don't need to understand Mojangs API routes, and just easily get the information you want. 

Mojangs rate limit is `600` requests per `10` minutes. If you go over this all requests will just return null!
