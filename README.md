# An Mojang API wrapper

This is an simple wrapper for Mojangs open API. Mojangs API is documented here [Mojang API](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_API)

Mojangs rate limit is 600 requests per 10 minutes. If you go over this all requests will just return null!

Not an official Minecraft API wrapper, I am not associated with Mojang or Microsoft.

Wrapper wiki is on its way, its in WIP right now [Wrapper docs](https://wrapperdocs.lukasabbe.com/)

# Installation

`npm install minecraft-api-wrapper`
